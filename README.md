# 2023 UN Datathon Day 1 Workshop
## Task
The workshop task is to gather and process data from the OECD about Russian trade in order to compare it to AIS data.

Try to apply the principles and practices discussed in the presentation earlier. That means try to:

- Consider what you would have done before the presentation and think about what you might do differently now  
- Make the process as automatic as possible  
- Make the process as flexible/extendable as possible  
- Use version control and make the project a git repository

## Steps
1.  Get the AIS data on the number of tankers and cargo ships visiting Russian ports. For simplicity, the AIS processing has already been done and the data is available here: [https://github.com/dhopp1/ais_russia_data/blob/main/russian_port_data.csv](https://github.com/dhopp1/ais_russia_data/blob/main/russian_port_data.csv)
2.  Get monthly Russian export data from the OECD (2019-01 to 2023-08). Use this dataset:
	-  [https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MEI_ARCHIVE#](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=MEI_ARCHIVE), Revisions Analysis Dataset â€“ Infra-annual Economic Indicators; take the data for each month from the latest edition available
3.  Convert the Russian data from Rubles to USD
4.  Combine the two datasets in order to create a plot showing the AIS data (tankers and cargo ships combined) compared to the OECD data

## What this repository does
- This repository accomplishes the task by running the `run_update.py` file, which, in sequence:
	- downloads the AIS data from GitHub
	- aggregates it to the monthly level
	- gets and cleans the OECD data
	- converts the OECD data to Rubles
	- saves the plot to disk
